Mainly to add some results evaluating the precision of Fiedler vector on the evaluation of node importance.

-In total, there are 2 results shown:
####1. Carry out Monte-Carlo simulation to see the divergence of Fiedler vector in our Fiedler estimation algorithm:
######Fiedler_divergence_random.m

####2. Carry out a simulation to evaluate the impact of precision on the estimation performance, using the NRD1 measurement:
#######Performance_precision.m
